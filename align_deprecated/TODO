dtwalign
#####################################
- maybe some documentation updates

dtwrefine (weak and strong)
#####################################
- a better way to define the cutoff
- maybe some documentation updates

dtwresid
#####################################
- make it work with vectors
- maybe some documentation updates

groupeval/aligneval
####################################
- more extensive use of Z-statistic
- clean up inputs/outputs
	- make it work with either vector or grid
- allow for a reweighted inversion 
	- reweight by misfit to solution
- devise a method to assure solution has consistent polarities
	- this may take an update to dtwrefine or a secondary function
	- need a simple method to search for inconsistencies
- eventually might consider simulated annealing
	- would search the model space better
	- requires signicantly more computation
	- no dtwrefine
	- need a measure of global misfit
