SEIZMO - passive seismology toolbox for Matlab & GNU Octave
Jayawijaya release series (2011-Jun-15)

1. What is SEIZMO?
------------------
A big set of routines that taken together aid you in learning and doing
research in seismology using Matlab or GNU Octave.  See the project website
for more details:
 http://epsc.wustl.edu/~ggeuler/codes/m/seizmo/

2. Downloading
--------------
2.1a Get the latest version (as a compressed tarball or zipfile) here:
      https://github.com/g2e/seizmo/archives/master
2.1b Or grab a tagged tarball: https://github.com/g2e/seizmo/downloads
2.1c Or if you have git installed (http://git-scm.com/), you may use it to
     retrieve the latest version:
      git clone git://github.com/g2e/seizmo.git
     and to update to the latest version (within the seizmo directory):
      git pull git://github.com/g2e/seizmo.git

3. Installation
---------------
3.1a If you went with route 2.1a or 2.1b then extract the tarball/zipfile
     somewhere on your filesystem.  Next, go into the extracted directory
     and start Matlab or GNU Octave.  Finally, run install_seizmo in Matlab
     or GNU Octave.  This function will remove any paths from previous
     SEIZMO installs and add paths for the current SEIZMO as needed.  Some
     operations will fail in Octave as they use unavailable features (no
     java support, etc).  Drop me a note if you are having trouble with the
     install.
3.1b If you went the git route (2.1c) then move into your new repository
     and open Matlab or GNU Octave.  Next, run install_seizmo in Matlab or
     GNU Octave.  NOTE: you may need to run install_seizmo even if you are
     only updating (using git) because the directories inside SEIZMO change
     from time to time so Matlab & GNU Octave need to be aware of this.
3.2 Next install the GSHHS binary files so you can plot coastlines, borders
    & rivers in your maps.  Type 'help seizmo_gshhs_webinstall' in Matlab
    or GNU Octave for help.

4. Getting Started
------------------
4.1a In Matlab: Type 'help seizmo' in the Matlab command window.  Follow
     the hyperlinks as desired.
4.1b In Octave: Type 'help <function>' where <function> is the function you
     want help with.  There is currently no over-arching help for seizmo in
     GNU Octave because this requires significant effort making info files.
4.2 REMEMBER: 'help <function>' or 'help <directory>'
    ex. help install_seizmo
        help seizmo_gshhs_webinstall
        help cmt

5. Contributing
---------------
5.1 Hack out some matlab/octave code & ask me to include it.
5.2 New codes start in the 'forge' directory.
5.3 Once reviewed the codes are moved to an appropriate (or new) directory.
