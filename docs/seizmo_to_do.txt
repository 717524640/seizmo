3cmp pairs
getheader returns nan


wide spread changes:
=======================
testing table

bugs:
========
- slidingavg doesn't handle offset out of range (entire result goes nan)
- check slidingavg against other running mean functions
- plotting is shit
	- allow pass-through of all properties
	- cleaner plotting routines
	- more options (like flags on bottom or on top)
	- more plot types

need to get done:
=================
decimate cascades should go greatest to least for efficiency
better polezero docs
	- units of poles and zeros
		- sac radians
	- what makes the constant
		- (2*pi)^(np-nz)
		- a0 (normalization constant - at wn the transfer function is 1 with a0)
		- sensor gain (sensitivity - gives appropriate units) 
		- digitizer gain (volts/bit - bit/volts)
	- dis 2 vel
		- add pole at 0
	- vel 2 dis
		- add zero at 0
make compatible with earliest matlab 7
	- grab a copy from somewhere
make work with octave
	- error needs to support structs
	- error needs to not error on blank messages
	- cell array of function handles should handle space separated (not require commas)
	- way to assign new field to empty struct
	- setdiff does not handle mixed char/cell
	- switch/case does not handle multi-case
	- replace textscan with fscanf/sscanf/fgetl

new function short list:
=========================
plotting
	- better properties handling
	- spectral
	- station map
	- station map movie (frame through samples)
	- cmp vs cmp (plot 2 components with time)
    - particle motion (color changing line to show time progression? how?)
    - true gui buttons could make this really nice
		- drop down(s) to select component (!!!)
		- phase picking
		- show predicted phase times
		- so much more...
read/write fixed format

wait listed:
================
ttbox integration
move cmb codes in
merge (uneven records)
mtconvert
mtrotate
