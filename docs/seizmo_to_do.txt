way to make movies while you do other things on the screen:
## hf = figure(‘visible’, ‘off’)
## addframe(aviobj, hf)

fsspec 12 3 4 5 6
    - horz & xchorz
    - corr
    - s(f,lat,lon) - should be a method
    - capon method
    - flag for normalizing cross spectra matrix

make_*_*_volumes depends on old DAYDIRS_STACKCORR layout

meld
    - uneven or variable samplerate
    - timing precision issue
rotate
    - through option
    - rewrite option code
rotate_correlations
    - works for unrotated

fk stuff
    rayleigh/love dispersion estimation
        - give it a slowness/velocity range
        - can we fit it as azimuthal anisotropy?
            - plot showing +/-10% variation with azimuth
    cub2 rayleigh/love dispersion estimation
        - can use for geofk scripts and much much more
        - need to calculate using Hermann codes
    	- need love dispersion & rayleigh phase & group dispersion
    	- functions for dispersion at position
    	- functions for depth model at position
	verify horizontal algorithm vs Haubrich and McCamy 1969
    cart2pol & pol2cart
    fss_phase2geofss
figure out strange narrow long-period peaks in noise results
    - response taper affects it
    - happens even without response removal?

plot_cmb_measurements
    - no horizontal errorbars (combine into one?)
    - use frequency?
affect of distance on measurements
affect of azimuth width on measurements
affect of minimum distance on measurements
all Pdiff A/B/C 1st pass
all SHdiff

more cmb models (rjk)
    - we need to allow parameter setting (while loop rather than for)
        - cell of numbers  {depths/heights  velo%s}
        - inputs will change per model or series ...
        - can never really do everything here ... just go for basics

syncsample
    - 1,2,3,4+ datasets
    - this will be underneath rotate, meld, rotate_correlations, 
omegaxcorr

new datasets
    - natural earth: http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/
    - gplates stuff
    - utig plate boundaries: ftp://ftp.ig.utexas.edu/pub/LIPS/Data/plate_boundaries/
    - seamounts: http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/PT/SMTS/main.html
    - ml & fz: http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/PT/GSFML/
    - seafloor age stuff: http://www.earthbyte.org/Research/Current/agegrid2008.html
    - srtm30plus 7.0

rename to MOSS:
    Matlab & Octave Seismology Scripts
    (Easy, Natural, Mo, PASSCAL & OSS ties!)
add screenshots for newer stuff
	- better 2pw kernels
	- cmts on maps, etc
	- mantle maps & profiles
	- other mapping features
	- power spectra

fix doc formatting
    - examples
    - description
fix checkheader calls (and remove redundant checks)
better versioninfo usage
    - caching should be dropped in all but the lowest level cases
    - seizmocheck should be used instead for the most part

improve top-level help file
    - some intros to basic signal processing tasks, cmts, plotting
    - walk-thrus of analysis codes
checking needs some tolerance (just too strict...)
    - delta/b often differ by a neglegible amount
slantstacking
vespagrams
ftan
writegmt
historical quakes
subduction zone contours/sheets
improved plotting
    - moving into the gui department would be nice for plotting only
      some records (like for pages of 20 records), changing axes, etc
    - header info on selection
	- cmp vs cmp (plot 2 components with time)
    - particle motion (color changing line to show time progression? how?)
    - true gui buttons could make this really nice
		- drop down(s) to select component (!!!)
		- phase picking
		- show predicted phase times
		- so much more...
3cmp support
    - how do we indicate 3cmp? iftype?
    - need functions to go from 1-cmp to 3-cmp and back
    - what to do if not all 3 exist?
    - this is great for rotations and particle motions
	- force as ZNE
	- how to handle gaps/overlaps
	- how to handle non-synced breaks in components
	- movies/plots of 3-d particle motion
	- movies/plots of 2-d particle motion
standard instrument responses database
    - this leads into inst resp checking
      ie. this is a STS-2 but the response
          is not as expected...
update polezero db
	- we should keep this external somehow...
		- installation requires running a cmt update
		  & a polezero update -- sounds good to me!
database of station info?
    - mda query functions...
    - rdseed 5.0+ pz output has stn info...
better polezero docs
	- units of poles and zeros
		- sac radians
	- what makes the constant
		- (2*pi)^(np-nz)
		- a0 (normalization constant - at wn the transfer function is 1 with a0)
		- sensor gain (sensitivity - gives appropriate units) 
		- digitizer gain (volts/bit - bit/volts)
	- dis 2 vel
		- add pole at 0
	- vel 2 dis
		- add zero at 0
	- SERIOUSLY FOLKS, why is there not a simple gui for this?
ffmancor
    - dynamic ray tracing is a must (see princeton group)
	- stretch/squish gradually starting at some depth
	- period sets up radial cos
    - define azimuthal cos
	- reflect off cmb
    - can we make this something like 1e-6 s/km^3 ?
sph harm mantle models
    - really need codes to synthesize info at points
ani mantle models
picking
    - better understanding of ppk in SAC
    - mimic it as much as possible
autopicking
    - sta/lta style
glitch & step removal
    - SAC has glitch detection ... implement it?
smooth spline removal (requires spline toolbox)
drop restrictive copyright functions
	buttord2 (edit of buttord)
	ddendrogram (edit of dendrogram)
slidingavg
    - nan support
    - check against other running mean functions
ttbox integration?
    - needs HUGE revamping for speed & output
    - this would give us Octave support of traveltimes!
getpeaks
markpeaks
basic segy (segy2MAT), ah, miniseed support

OCTAVE SPECIFIC STUFF
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
- error & warning need sprintf support
- octave-java package issues with Fedora (as root):
    cd /usr/lib/jvm/
    ln -s /etc/alternatives/java_sdk default-java
    cd /usr/lib/jvm/default-java/jre/lib/amd64/
    ln -s server client
- no import function
    - use javaObject & javaMethod
- concatenation differs if cells & empties involved
    - avoid multitype concatenation
- box doesn't take ax (patch applied to devel branch)
- a(b(end)) fails if a not declared (fix applied to stable branch)
- addpath works backwards
- rmpath/unzip etc beat text to the prompt
- unzip on existing unzipped contents will look stalled
    - type y/n/A/N to get through it
- no texlabel
- no axescheck (use personal axparse function)
