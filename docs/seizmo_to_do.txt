ww3struct
    - autoload .jars if not found

makearrivals == creates .misc.arrivals
findarrivals == searches .misc.arrivals
arrivals2picks == push .misc.arrivals to header pick fields
findpicks == searches t* fields

- startup.m file?
  - addpath
  - javaaddpath

default verbose off
    - when using parallel toolbox

meld
    - uneven or variable samplerate
rotate
    - through option
    - rewrite option code
rotate_correlations
    - works for unrotated

fk stuff
x	add weighting to all
    rayleigh/love dispersion estimation
        - give it a slowness/velocity range
        - can we fit it as azimuthal anisotropy?
            - plot showing +/-10% variation with azimuth
    cub2 rayleigh/love dispersion estimation
        - can use for geofk scripts and much much more
        - need to calculate using Hermann codes
    	- need love dispersion & rayleigh phase & group dispersion
    	- functions for dispersion at position
    	- functions for depth model at position
	weight optimization function to reduce array response
        - capon 1969, etc
		- haubrich 1968
        - test on ARFs
	verify horizontal algorithm vs Haubrich and McCamy 1969
	make scripts for
        vol/map set 2 mov (???)
		fkhorzmap       - handles N/E input
		fkhorzvolume    - handles N/E input
		geofkmap        - alg changes
		geofkhorzmap    - alg changes
		geofkvolume     - alg changes
		geofkhorzvolume - alg changes
		geofkxcmap      - alg changes
		geofkxchorzmap  - alg changes
figure out strange narrow long-period peaks in noise results
    - response taper affects it
    - happens even without response removal?
plot_cmb_measurements
    - no horizontal errorbars (combine into one?)
    - use frequency?
affect of distance on measurements
affect of azimuth width on measurements
affect of minimum distance on measurements
all Pdiff A/B/C 1st pass
all SHdiff
prep global on terra

cmt subtoolbox
    - mt to strike-dip-rake
    - mt to principal axes
    - principal axes to mt

more cmb models (rjk)
    - we need to allow parameter setting (while loop rather than for)
        - cell of numbers  {depths/heights  velo%s}
        - inputs will change per model or series ...
        - can never really do everything here ... just go for basics

    - srtm30plus 7.0

rename to MOSS:
    Matlab & Octave Seismology Scripts
    (Easy, Natural, Mo, PASSCAL & OSS ties!)
add screenshots for newer stuff
	- better 2pw kernels
	- cmts on maps, etc
	- mantle maps & profiles
	- other mapping features
	- power spectra

fix doc formatting
    - examples
    - description
fix checkheader calls (and remove redundant checks)
drop getlgc/getenum*
better versioninfo usage
    - caching should be dropped in all but the lowest level cases
    - seizmocheck should be used instead for the most part

improve top-level help file
    - some intros to basic signal processing tasks, cmts, plotting
    - walk-thrus of analysis codes
checking needs some tolerance (just too strict...)
    - delta/b often are differ by a neglegible amount
slantstacking
vespagrams
ftan
writegmt
historical quakes
subduction zone contours/sheets
improved plotting
    - moving into the gui department would be nice for plotting only
      some records (like for pages of 20 records), changing axes, etc
    - header info on selection
	- cmp vs cmp (plot 2 components with time)
    - particle motion (color changing line to show time progression? how?)
    - true gui buttons could make this really nice
		- drop down(s) to select component (!!!)
		- phase picking
		- show predicted phase times
		- so much more...
3cmp support
    - how do we indicate 3cmp? iftype?
    - need functions to go from 1-cmp to 3-cmp and back
    - what to do if not all 3 exist?
    - this is great for rotations and particle motions
	- force as ZNE
	- how to handle gaps/overlaps
	- how to handle non-synced breaks in components
	- movies/plots of 3-d particle motion
	- movies/plots of 2-d particle motion
standard instrument responses database
    - this leads into inst resp checking
      ie. this is a STS-2 but the response
          is not as expected...
update polezero db
	- we should keep this external somehow...
		- installation requires running a cmt update
		  & a polezero update -- sounds good to me!
database of station info?
    - mda query functions...
    - rdseed 5.0+ pz output has stn info...
better polezero docs
	- units of poles and zeros
		- sac radians
	- what makes the constant
		- (2*pi)^(np-nz)
		- a0 (normalization constant - at wn the transfer function is 1 with a0)
		- sensor gain (sensitivity - gives appropriate units) 
		- digitizer gain (volts/bit - bit/volts)
	- dis 2 vel
		- add pole at 0
	- vel 2 dis
		- add zero at 0
	- SERIOUSLY FOLKS, why is there not a simple gui for this?
ffmancor
    - dynamic ray tracing is a must (see princeton group)
	- stretch/squish gradually starting at some depth
	- period sets up radial cos
    - define azimuthal cos
	- reflect off cmb
    - can we make this something like 1e-6 s/km^3 ?
sph harm mantle models
    - really need codes to synthesize info at points
ani mantle models
picking
    - better understanding of ppk in SAC
    - mimic it as much as possible
autopicking
    - sta/lta style
glitch & step removal
    - SAC has glitch detection ... implement it?
smooth spline removal (requires spline toolbox)
drop restrictive copyright functions
	buttord2 (edit of buttord)
	ddendrogram (edit of dendrogram)
taup improvements
    clean up tauppierce extra output
    taup* functions should handle args that are vectors (ie multi-station)
    drop mattaup, use taup jar directly
    .taup support (use global?)
    some way to add, list, export models (ie taupcreate++)
slidingavg
    - nan support
    - check against other running mean functions
ttbox integration?
    - needs HUGE revamping for speed & output
    - this would give us Octave support of traveltimes!
getpeaks
markpeaks
basic segy (segy2MAT), ah, miniseed support

OCTAVE SPECIFIC STUFF (Need to test vs 3.6.1)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
- error & warning need sprintf support
- fix conflicts with octave functions:
  rainbow (same but reversed order? not a big deal)
  ocean (similar but mine (gmt's) has greens ... not a big deal)
  cut (not sure ... non-matlab statistics function ...)
     - no usage in stats
     slice, slash, trim, chop, clip, snip
- octave-java package issues with Fedora (as root):
    cd /usr/lib/jvm/
    ln -s /etc/alternatives/java_sdk default-java
    cd /usr/lib/jvm/default-java/jre/lib/amd64/
    ln -s server client
- no import function
    - apparently javaObject should be used...
- concatenation differs if cells & empties involved (using cellcat)
- box doesn't take ax (patch submitted)
- a(b(end)) fails if a not declared (fixed upstream)
- addpath works backwards
- rmpath/unzip etc beat text to the prompt
- unzip on existing unzipped contents will look stalled
    - use y/n/A/N
- no texlabel
- require: java, signal
