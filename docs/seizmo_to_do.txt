my todo list
%%%%%%%%%%%%
improved plotting
    - moving into the gui department would be nice for plotting only
      some records (like for pages of 20 records), changing axes, etc
    - select records where you can actually select the record
    - header info on selection
    - station map movie (frame through samples)
	- cmp vs cmp (plot 2 components with time)
    - particle motion (color changing line to show time progression? how?)
    - true gui buttons could make this really nice
		- drop down(s) to select component (!!!)
		- phase picking
		- show predicted phase times
		- so much more...
3cmp support
    - how do we indicate 3cmp? iftype?
    - need functions to go from 1-cmp to 3-cmp and back
    - what to do if not all 3 exist?
    - this is great for rotations and particle motions
	- force as ZNE
	- how to handle gaps/overlaps
	- how to handle non-synced breaks in components
	- movies/plots of 3-d particle motion
	- movies/plots of 2-d particle motion
standard instrument responses database
    - this leads into inst resp checking
      ie. this is a STS-2 but the response
          is not as expected...
cmt subtoolbox
    - lots of work needed here
ffmancor
    - dynamic ray tracing is a must (see princeton group)
	- stretch/squish gradually starting at some depth
	- period sets up radial cos
    - define azimuthal cos
	- reflect off cmb
    - can we make this something like 1e-6 s/km^3 ?
sph harm mantle models
    - really need codes to synthesize info at points
ani mantle models
    - 
plotting profiles for models
    - need a decent polar plotting program to plot slices of the pie
      with inner & outer radii specified.  Not even mmpolar does it.
more cmb models (rjk)
cub2 functions
    - functions to get phase/group speed at point/period
    - functions for depth model
	- rayleigh & love travel times!
absolute time windowing
    - add abs time windowing to CUT
picking
    - better understanding of ppk in SAC
    - mimic it as much as possible
autopicking
    - sta/lta style
glitch & step removal
    - SAC has glitch detection ... implement it?
smooth spline removal
    - requires spline toolbox
vespagrams
    - need slant-stacking first
ftan
    - how is the filtering done?
slantstacking
power spectrum estimation
merge (uneven)
    - simple in theory, but the coding will be tough
drop restrictive copyright functions
	buttord2 (edit of buttord)
	ddendrogram (edit of dendrogram)
	ppdcval (edit of ppval)
fk stuff
x	add weighting to all
    rayleigh/love dispersion estimation
	weight optimization function
		capon 1969, etc
		haubrich 1968
	verify horzizontal algorithm vs Haubrich and McCamy 1969
	make scripts for
		3hour
		daily
		1mon
        vol/map set 2 mov
	x	fkxcmap
	x	fkxchorzmap
		fkhorzmap
		fkhorzvolume
		geofkmap
		geofkhorzmap
		geofkvolume
		geofkhorzvolume
		geofkxcmap
		geofkxchorzmap
expand sph tri stuff
	use delaunay codes
database of station info (mda query?)
better polezero docs
	- units of poles and zeros
		- sac radians
	- what makes the constant
		- (2*pi)^(np-nz)
		- a0 (normalization constant - at wn the transfer function is 1 with a0)
		- sensor gain (sensitivity - gives appropriate units) 
		- digitizer gain (volts/bit - bit/volts)
	- dis 2 vel
		- add pole at 0
	- vel 2 dis
		- add zero at 0
	- SERIOUSLY FOLKS, why is there not a simple gui for this?
improve top-level help file
make noise processing more flexible (file length & overlap)
******************************************
***** FIX FREQWINDOW & GOODUGLYCHECK *****
******************************************
add in pwave picking fk routines
taup improvements
    clean up tauppierce extra output
    taup* functions should handle args that are vectors (ie multi-station)
    drop mattaup, use taup jar directly
    .taup support (use global?)
    some way to add, list, export models (ie taupcreate++)
slidingavg
    - nan support
    - check against other running mean functions
ttbox integration
    - needs HUGE revamping for speed & output
    - this would give us Octave support!
getpeaks
markpeaks
function to make g matrix for sph tri stuff

test Octave java package
    - no import ... how to do this otherwise?
fix stft conflict in octave

plate boundaries datasets
	- have subsets of divergent, convergent, transform
impacts/volcanoes/historical eq location datasets

two plane wave phase velocity maps
	- anisotropy
	- station corrections
	- attenuation
