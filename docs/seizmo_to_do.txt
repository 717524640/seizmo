database of station info (mda query?)


older lists follow below:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

bugs:
========
- slidingavg doesn't handle offset out of range (entire result goes nan)
- check slidingavg against other running mean functions

need to get done:
=================
better polezero docs
	- units of poles and zeros
		- sac radians
	- what makes the constant
		- (2*pi)^(np-nz)
		- a0 (normalization constant - at wn the transfer function is 1 with a0)
		- sensor gain (sensitivity - gives appropriate units) 
		- digitizer gain (volts/bit - bit/volts)
	- dis 2 vel
		- add pole at 0
	- vel 2 dis
		- add zero at 0
	- SERIOUSLY FOLKS, why is there not a simple gui for this?
plotting
	- station map movie (frame through samples)
	- cmp vs cmp (plot 2 components with time)
    - particle motion (color changing line to show time progression? how?)
    - true gui buttons could make this really nice
		- drop down(s) to select component (!!!)
		- phase picking
		- show predicted phase times
		- so much more...

wait listed:
================
ttbox integration
merge (uneven records)
mtconvert
mtrotate

goals on my mind
----------------
ffmancor
    - main problem is not having dynamic raytracing
	- stretch/squish gradually starting at some depth
	- period sets up radial cos
    - define azimuthal cos
	- reflect off cmb
    - can we make this something like 1e-6 s/km^3 ?


0.6.0 - stable, helpful and functional
----------------------------------------
signal cleaning (to do)
	- robust poly (get, remove)
	- smooth splines (get, remove)
	- glitches (get, remove)
	- steps (get, remove)
other new functions
	- autopick
	- pick
3-cmp records
	force as ZNE
	how to handle gaps/overlaps
	how to handle non-synced breaks in components
	movies/plots of 3-d particle motion
	movies/plots of 2-d particle motion
getpeaks
markpeaks
function to make g matrix for sph tri stuff
