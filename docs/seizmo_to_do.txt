drop restrictive copyright functions
	buttord2
	ddendrogram
	mmpolar
	ppdcval


older lists follow below:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

bugs:
========
- slidingavg doesn't handle offset out of range (entire result goes nan)
- check slidingavg against other running mean functions
- plotting is shit
	- allow pass-through of all properties
	- cleaner plotting routines
	- more options (like flags on bottom or on top)
	- more plot types

need to get done:
=================
decimate cascades should go greatest to least for efficiency
better polezero docs
	- units of poles and zeros
		- sac radians
	- what makes the constant
		- (2*pi)^(np-nz)
		- a0 (normalization constant - at wn the transfer function is 1 with a0)
		- sensor gain (sensitivity - gives appropriate units) 
		- digitizer gain (volts/bit - bit/volts)
	- dis 2 vel
		- add pole at 0
	- vel 2 dis
		- add zero at 0
make compatible with earliest matlab 7
	- grab a copy from somewhere
make work with octave
	- error needs to support structs
	- error needs to not error on blank messages
	- cell array of function handles should handle space separated (not require commas)
	- way to assign new field to empty struct
	- setdiff does not handle mixed char/cell
	- switch/case does not handle multi-case
	- replace textscan with fscanf/sscanf/fgetl

new function short list:
=========================
plotting
	- better properties handling
	- spectral
	- station map
	- station map movie (frame through samples)
	- cmp vs cmp (plot 2 components with time)
    - particle motion (color changing line to show time progression? how?)
    - true gui buttons could make this really nice
		- drop down(s) to select component (!!!)
		- phase picking
		- show predicted phase times
		- so much more...
read/write fixed format

wait listed:
================
ttbox integration
move cmb codes in
merge (uneven records)
mtconvert
mtrotate

goals on my mind
----------------
ffmancor
    - main problem is not having dynamic raytracing
	- stretch/squish gradually starting at some depth
	- period sets up radial cos
    - define azimuthal cos
	- reflect off cmb
    - can we make this something like 1e-6 s/km^3 ?
make_reflect_input
	- custom readwr.f
	- read_reflect_output
more mantle models
	- handle rg models
	- handle sph models
more cmb models
	- rjk
plotting options!!!
make guis for cut functions
	- popcut
	- arrcut
	- errcut
	- ampcut
make multiband align
	- how do we save all this info?
		- need to save all the figures
		- need to save all the arrival info
			- should be easy to reaccess
		- can we export it all?
cmt convert functions


0.6.0 - stable, helpful and functional
----------------------------------------
document every function (working on)
	- plotting (waiting on rewrite)
fix plotting
	- better global setting (like binoperr?)
	- better option passing
	- allow turning markers on/off
	- allow setting markers above/below
	- ditto for tt curves (only recsec)
	- flags or line for predicted?
	- spectral plotting
	- plot clusters
	- plotvs
	- plotxy
	- particle motion plots (cmp vs cmp)
signal cleaning (to do)
	- robust poly (get, remove)
	- smooth splines (get, remove)
	- glitches (get, remove)
	- steps (get, remove)
other new functions
	- autopick
	- pick
	- changeversion/filetype
possible extras
	- cut on absolute times
	- merge uneven & multi-rate
3-cmp records
	force as ZNE
	how to handle gaps/overlaps
	how to handle non-synced breaks in components
	movies/plots of 3-d particle motion
	movies/plots of 2-d particle motion
getpeaks
markpeaks
routines to plot models
function to make g matrix for sph tri stuff
vespagrams
ftan
slantstacking
spectrum estimation
