fk stuff
x	add weighting to all
    rayleigh/love dispersion estimation
        - give it a slowness/velocity range
        - can we fit it as azimuthal anisotropy?
            - plot showing +/-10% variation with azimuth
    cub2 rayleigh/love dispersion estimation
        - can use for geofk scripts and much much more
        - need to calculate using Hermann codes
	weight optimization function
		capon 1969, etc
		haubrich 1968
	verify horizontal algorithm vs Haubrich and McCamy 1969
	make scripts for
        vol/map set 2 mov (???)
	x	fkxcmap
	x	fkxchorzmap
		fkhorzmap
		fkhorzvolume
		geofkmap
		geofkhorzmap
		geofkvolume
		geofkhorzvolume
		geofkxcmap
		geofkxchorzmap
make noise processing more flexible (file length & overlap)
    - major overhaul of mergecut script
    - new directory structure:
      - YYYY/DDD.HH.MM.SS
      - YYYY/YYYY.DDD.HH.MM.SS_YYYY.DDD.HH.MM.SS
    - does any script depend on length of records?
      - one bug fixed in normalization of horizontals
    - stacking is more difficult
    - is directory overwrite ok for all commands?
        - definitely not going to work for correlation
    - can we chain commands?
        - this would consume too much memory to have the entire dataset
          in memory at once -- need to proceed time section by time section
          but how do we do this???
        - ANSWER: NO ... we have to write an all-at-once command for this
figure out the damn stationary noise!!!
    - response taper affects it
    - happens even without response removal?

plot_cmb_measurements
    - no horizontal errorbars (combine into one?)
    - use frequency?
affect of distance on measurements
affect of azimuth width on measurements
affect of minimum distance on measurements
all Pdiff A/B/C 1st pass
all SHdiff
prep global on terra

cmt subtoolbox
    - mt to strike-dip-rake
    - mt to principal axes
    - principal axes to mt

more cmb models (rjk)
    - we need to allow parameter setting (while loop rather than for)
        - cell of numbers  {depths/heights  velo%s}
        - inputs will change per model or series ...
        - can never really do everything here ... just go for basics
expand sph tri stuff
    - function to make g matrix for sph tri stuff
      - distance from polygon center to pnts on line
        - simple logical for flat weighting
        - distance based gaussian weighting
      - inversion is % from prem?
        - have to do synthetics for all events


%%%%%%%
POSTDOC
%%%%%%%

fix doc formatting
    - examples
    - description
fix checkheader calls (and remove redundant checks)

improve top-level help file
    - some intros to basic signal processing tasks, cmts, plotting
    - walk-thrus of analysis codes
power spectrum estimation
slantstacking
vespagrams
ftan
writegmt
historical quakes
subduction zone contours/sheets
improved plotting
    - moving into the gui department would be nice for plotting only
      some records (like for pages of 20 records), changing axes, etc
    - header info on selection
	- cmp vs cmp (plot 2 components with time)
    - particle motion (color changing line to show time progression? how?)
    - true gui buttons could make this really nice
		- drop down(s) to select component (!!!)
		- phase picking
		- show predicted phase times
		- so much more...
3cmp support
    - how do we indicate 3cmp? iftype?
    - need functions to go from 1-cmp to 3-cmp and back
    - what to do if not all 3 exist?
    - this is great for rotations and particle motions
	- force as ZNE
	- how to handle gaps/overlaps
	- how to handle non-synced breaks in components
	- movies/plots of 3-d particle motion
	- movies/plots of 2-d particle motion
standard instrument responses database
    - this leads into inst resp checking
      ie. this is a STS-2 but the response
          is not as expected...
ffmancor
    - dynamic ray tracing is a must (see princeton group)
	- stretch/squish gradually starting at some depth
	- period sets up radial cos
    - define azimuthal cos
	- reflect off cmb
    - can we make this something like 1e-6 s/km^3 ?
sph harm mantle models
    - really need codes to synthesize info at points
ani mantle models
cub2 functions
    - need love dispersion & rayleigh phase dispersion
    - functions for dispersion at position
    - functions for depth model at position
picking
    - better understanding of ppk in SAC
    - mimic it as much as possible
autopicking
    - sta/lta style
glitch & step removal
    - SAC has glitch detection ... implement it?
smooth spline removal (requires spline toolbox)
merge (uneven)
    - simple in theory, but the coding will be tough
drop restrictive copyright functions
	buttord2 (edit of buttord)
	ddendrogram (edit of dendrogram)
database of station info (mda query?)
better polezero docs
	- units of poles and zeros
		- sac radians
	- what makes the constant
		- (2*pi)^(np-nz)
		- a0 (normalization constant - at wn the transfer function is 1 with a0)
		- sensor gain (sensitivity - gives appropriate units) 
		- digitizer gain (volts/bit - bit/volts)
	- dis 2 vel
		- add pole at 0
	- vel 2 dis
		- add zero at 0
	- SERIOUSLY FOLKS, why is there not a simple gui for this?
taup improvements
    clean up tauppierce extra output
    taup* functions should handle args that are vectors (ie multi-station)
    drop mattaup, use taup jar directly
    .taup support (use global?)
    some way to add, list, export models (ie taupcreate++)
slidingavg
    - nan support
    - check against other running mean functions
ttbox integration?
    - needs HUGE revamping for speed & output
    - this would give us Octave support!
getpeaks
markpeaks
basic segy (segy2MAT), ah, miniseed support

way to make movies while you do other things on the screen:
## hf = figure(‘visible’, ‘off’)
## addframe(aviobj, hf)

OCTAVE STUFF
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
- error (warning?) needs sprintf support
- how to do java packages in Octave??
- mex files in Octave??
- fix conflicts with octave functions:
  rainbow (same but reversed order? not a big deal)
  ocean (similar but mine (gmt's) has greens ... not a big deal)
  split (deprecated function in octave so its fine)
  merge (not sure ... ifelse is the same thing ... non-matlab)
     - getfield, setfield, nthroot use octave's merge ... this is bad news!
  cut (not sure ... non-matlab statistics function ...)
     - no usage in stats
