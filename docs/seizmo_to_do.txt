main things needing done
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
improved plotting (seriously)
3cmp support
standard instrument responses database
cmt subtoolbox
xcalign subtoolbox
ffmancor
sph harm mantle models
ani mantle models
plotting profiles for models
more cmb models (rjk)
cub2 functions
absolute time windowing
picking
autopicking
glitch & step removal
smooth spline removal
vespagrams
ftan
slantstacking
power spectrum estimation
merge (uneven)
drop restrictive copyright functions
	buttord2
	ddendrogram
	mmpolar
	ppdcval


older lists follow below:

bugs:
========
- slidingavg doesn't handle offset out of range (entire result goes nan)
- check slidingavg against other running mean functions

need to get done:
=================
better polezero docs
	- units of poles and zeros
		- sac radians
	- what makes the constant
		- (2*pi)^(np-nz)
		- a0 (normalization constant - at wn the transfer function is 1 with a0)
		- sensor gain (sensitivity - gives appropriate units) 
		- digitizer gain (volts/bit - bit/volts)
	- dis 2 vel
		- add pole at 0
	- vel 2 dis
		- add zero at 0
plotting
	- station map movie (frame through samples)
	- cmp vs cmp (plot 2 components with time)
    - particle motion (color changing line to show time progression? how?)
    - true gui buttons could make this really nice
		- drop down(s) to select component (!!!)
		- phase picking
		- show predicted phase times
		- so much more...

wait listed:
================
ttbox integration
merge (uneven records)
mtconvert
mtrotate

goals on my mind
----------------
ffmancor
    - main problem is not having dynamic raytracing
	- stretch/squish gradually starting at some depth
	- period sets up radial cos
    - define azimuthal cos
	- reflect off cmb
    - can we make this something like 1e-6 s/km^3 ?
make guis for cut functions
	- popcut
	- arrcut
	- errcut
	- ampcut
make multiband align
	- how do we save all this info?
		- need to save all the figures
		- need to save all the arrival info
			- should be easy to reaccess
		- can we export it all?


0.6.0 - stable, helpful and functional
----------------------------------------
signal cleaning (to do)
	- robust poly (get, remove)
	- smooth splines (get, remove)
	- glitches (get, remove)
	- steps (get, remove)
other new functions
	- autopick
	- pick
3-cmp records
	force as ZNE
	how to handle gaps/overlaps
	how to handle non-synced breaks in components
	movies/plots of 3-d particle motion
	movies/plots of 2-d particle motion
getpeaks
markpeaks
function to make g matrix for sph tri stuff
