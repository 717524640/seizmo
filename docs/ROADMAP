0.5.3 - plotting and filtering
-----
fix p1 and p3
spectral plotting (pspec1, pspec2, pspec3)
plot choose component (pcmp1, pcmp2, pcmp3)
plot particle motion (multi-component)
picking phases (get familiar with ppk)
unwrap	- unwrapped phase
dftshift- is this wanted?
fix up filtering
	- fir
	- iirfilter
		- allow variable input
		- clean up the corners
		- figure out best way to handle overdesigned filters
			- make sure there is output showing changes
	- wiener?
	- whiten



0.5.4 - change versions, polezeros, fitting and glitches
--------------------------------------------------------
cv	- change version
pz	- add/remove polezeros (transfer predecessor)
fitting
	- get poly (gpoly)
	- rem poly (rpoly)
	- get smooth spline (gspline)
	- rem smooth spline (rspline)
	- get robust poly (grobpoly)
	- rem robust poly (rrobpoly)
signal cleaning
	- detect glitches (gspikes)
	- rem glitches (rspikes)
	- detect offsets (goffsets)
	- rem offsets (roffsets)
get header definition (ghd)
	- for cleaning up some low level functions
	- inputs should contain necessary parent fields too
	- allow structure output??



0.5.5 - virtual header fields
-------------------------------
how to handle virtual <=> real
	- use function handles
		- try to use anonymous functions
		- may have to write functions (put in private folder) for complex jobs
	- adjustments to seisdef
		- new definition type virt
			- definition.virt.(type).(field)
				- subsection listing reference fields (fields)
				- subsections containing function handles to make/undo virtual field
		- update ch, gh, lh
virtual fields to support
	- nzdttm
	- kzdate
	- kztime
	- nzday
	- nzmonth
	- picks
	- default
	- default1
	- all
	- full
better handling of timing
	- allow setting time-related fields using absolute times
		- SAC uses a 'GMT' preceeding y m d h m s  (required ???)
		- set to undefined if reference time cannot be determined (SAC ???)
	- ability to offset all time-related fields together
		- SAC uses ALLT in CHNHDR to do this
		- can it be done with virtual field?
	- synchronize 
		- match SAC
		- add option to sync to earliest begin time



0.5.6 - travel times and autopicking
---------------------------------
matTauP integration
TTBox integration
travel time curves in plots
automark



0.5.7 - guis
-------------
windowing
aligning
picking
deleting (selectrecs done!)



0.5.8+ - 3D files, transfer, mapping, ?
--------------------------------


0.6.0
------
single internal format
	- removes undefined being specific
	- cleans up code quite a bit
	- simplifies code quite a bit
virtual fields and groups
	- allows for a number of sac features
support absolute times
	- less trouble for user
negative delta support
	- or at least know where the problems are
.filetype support
	- infrastructure for supporting more filetypes
filename cleanup
	- names should be less conflicting
	- add shortcut folder


0.7.0 - css
------------
find other data filetypes
figure out how to read/write other filetypes
convert to css
import/export css
