0.6.0 - stable, helpful and functional
----------------------------------------
virtual fields and groups (working on)
	- vgrp
		- picks
		- default
		- default1
		- all
		- full
		- t utc, user utc, resp utc
		- t tai, user tai, resp tai
	- allows for a number of sac features
	- function handles to go to/from underlying fields
	- what do func. expect in, what do they put out
		- do we hardcode? ...i think we have to
		- pass h,head
			- ch returns updated head
			- gh, cmph, lh returns field
support absolute times (working on)
	- less trouble for user
	- need to add to ch and gh
		- undefined if reftime undefined
	- absolute time vgrps next
	- cell array input/output pretty much req
negative delta support (...)
	- or at least know where the problems are
.filetype support (done)
	- infrastructure for supporting more filetypes
filename cleanup (done?)
	- names should be less conflicting
	- add shortcut folder
document every function (working on)
	- iirfilter (waiting on rewrite)
	- plotting (waiting on rewrite)
	- align/cluster (waiting on rewrite)
	- tpw (waiting on rewrite)
	- eqdp (queued after above)
fix iirfilter
	- modularize
		- separate design from implementation
	- allow filter struct or polezero in/out
	- filterdesign function
fix plotting
	- better global setting (like binoperr?)
	- better option passing
	- allow turning markers on/off
	- allow setting markers above/below
	- ditto for tt curves (only recsec)
	- flags or line for predicted?
fix checkheader
	- method (skip/check/fix)
	- report (silent/warn/error)
	- infrastructure to alter (like binoperr?)
travel time correction
	- get more models
		- where to put them
		- decide best struct layout
	- write correction routines
response
	- findsacpz
		- allow dir input
		- need default dir
		- sacpz db
	- apply/remove sacpz
	- sacpz2fap
	- resp? (gonna be a pita)
signal cleaning (to do)
	- robust poly (get, remove)
	- smooth splines (get, remove)
	- glitches (get, remove)
	- steps (get, remove)
other new functions
	- autopick
	- useralign
	- usercluster
	- pick
	- unwrap
	- changeversion/filetype
	- spectral plotting
	- particle motion plots (cmp vs cmp)
	- check orientation
	- rotate
	- convolve
	- deconvolve
get header definition (ghd)
	- for cleaning up some low level functions
	- inputs should contain necessary parent fields too
	- allow structure output??


0.7.0 - css?
------------
single internal format
	- removes undefined being specific
	- cleans up code quite a bit
	- simplifies code quite a bit
find other data filetypes
	- miniseed
	- segy
	- sac ascii
	- ah
	- css
	- reflect
figure out how to read/write other filetypes
convert to css
import/export css
