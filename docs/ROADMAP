0.6.0 - stable, helpful and functional
----------------------------------------
document every function (working on)
	- iirfilter (waiting on rewrite)
	- plotting (waiting on rewrite)
	- align/cluster (waiting on rewrite)
	- tpw (waiting on rewrite)
	- eqdb (queued after above)
fix iirfilter
	- modularize
		- separate design from implementation
	- allow filter struct or polezero in/out
	- filterdesign function
fix plotting
	- better global setting (like binoperr?)
	- better option passing
	- allow turning markers on/off
	- allow setting markers above/below
	- ditto for tt curves (only recsec)
	- flags or line for predicted?
travel time correction
	- get more models
		- where to put them
		- decide best struct layout
	- write correction routines
signal cleaning (to do)
	- robust poly (get, remove)
	- smooth splines (get, remove)
	- glitches (get, remove)
	- steps (get, remove)
other new functions
	- autopick
	- useralign
	- usercluster
	- pick
	- changeversion/filetype
	- spectral plotting
	- particle motion plots (cmp vs cmp)
	- check orientation
	- rotate
possible extras
	- cut on absolute times
	- amph2rlim/rlim2amph 2nd output is converted logicals
	- merge uneven & multi-rate
changeheader
	- output nan for undefined? (nan already output for unknown field)
3-cmp records
	force as ZNE
	how to handle gaps/overlaps
	how to handle non-synced breaks in components
	movies/plots of 3-d particle motion
	movies/plots of 2-d particle motion
listheader/compareheader - fix reftime hack
getheader/changeheader - versioninfo caching
versioninfo caching for other functions (only if getheader/changeheader done)
getpeaks
markpeaks
verbosity support
try/catch
routines to plot models
routines to plot raypaths
function to make g matrix for sph tri stuff
array functions
	stacks
	beams
	fk
	vespa

0.7.0 - css?
------------
single internal format
	- removes undefined being specific
	- cleans up code quite a bit
	- simplifies code quite a bit
find other data filetypes
	- miniseed
	- segy
	- sac ascii
	- ah
	- css
	- reflect
figure out how to read/write other filetypes
convert to css
import/export css
