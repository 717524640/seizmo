<·.¸¸.+¤®°¨¯¨°®¤+.¸¸.·>Installing SEIZMO<·.¸¸.+¤®°¨¯¨°®¤+.¸¸.·>


How I install SEIZMO for Matlab on our machines:

1. Download and extract the tar volume in the directory
   you want the SEIZMO directory tree to reside:
        cd ~   (your home directory for example)
        mv seizmo seizmo-old  (move old seizmo install out of the way)
        tar jxvf seizmo-devel-rXXX.tar.gz

2. This creates the directory "seizmo" in the current directory.
   Beneath that directory is another called "devel" that is the actual
   root directory.  I move "devel" out of "seizmo" and rename it.
        cd seizmo
        mv devel ..
        rmdir seizmo
        mv devel seizmo

3. Add the following folders to your Matlab path:
        seizmo/           (main stuff)
        seizmo/misc       (some (un)necessary various functions)
        seizmo/position   (some (un)necessary earth positioning functions)
        seizmo/time       (some (un)necessary time functions)

4. Add mattaup & m_map functionality by including the following
   folders in your Matlab path too.  These are not necessary for
   basic functions but not having them will break plenty of others.
   Note that custom versions of both are currently included (m_map
   edits are minor so you CAN use your own but you will probably hit
   some issues I fixed).
        seizmo/mattaup     (taup access)
        seizmo/m_map/1.4e  (m_map routines)

   Add the mattaup jar-file in Matlab using 'edit classpath.txt' (as admin):
        seizmo/devel/mattaup/lib/matTaup.jar

   Make sure the GSHHS binary files are on the Matlab path too!  I have a
   folder named 'gshhs' in the same directory as seizmo that holds all the
   coastline/border/river files.


Thats it! The rest is optional. Good luck!

The following directories are optional, but highly recommended:
   seizmo/cmap                  (color maps - useful if you like GMT colors)
   seizmo/event                 (useful functions for cmt & mlocate stuff)
   seizmo/fk                    (fk analysis functions)
   seizmo/gui                   (interactive plot/menu functions)
   seizmo/models                (earth model functions)
   seizmo/response              (instrument response functions & database)
   seizmo/shortnames            (short-named links to longer-named functions)
   seizmo/ttcorrect             (travel time correction + raypath routines)
   seizmo/xcalign               (multichannel xc arrival alignment functions)

These may also be of help:
   seizmo/fixes                 (header fixing routines for extraction utilities)
   seizmo/invert                (some inversion scripts)
   seizmo/seizmo_internal       (link to seizmo private functions)
   seizmo/ww3                   (WaveWatch III routines)

These are currently unfinished/broken but are useful:
   seizmo/cmt                (cmt functions)
   seizmo/noise              (ambient noise analysis functions)
   seizmo/synth              (functions for working with synthetics)
   seizmo/tomo               (tomography functions from GDA)
   seizmo/topo               (topo data functions)
   seizmo/tpw                (some functions related to two plane wave analysis)

These directories are external scripts included for your convenience:
   seizmo/external           (misc stuff I thought was cool or might come in handy)

These should be left off of your path:
   seizmo/docs               (just text files)
   seizmo/unfinished         (for development)


<·.¸¸.+¤®°¨¯¨°®¤+.¸¸.·>Using SEIZMO<·.¸¸.+¤®°¨¯¨°®¤+.¸¸.·>


The best way to start using SEIZMO is to invest some time
in browsing the functions using Matlab's 'help' command.  
To get a list of all the main functions along with a quick
description:

help seizmo

You can list functions from other directories as well:
help misc
help time
help position
help mattaup
help shortnames
help seizmo_internal
help gui

Use that list to learn more about individual functions or
type:

help <function>

to jump to a specific function.


<·.¸¸.+¤®°¨¯¨°®¤+.¸¸.·>Reading/Writing SAC Files<·.¸¸.+¤®°¨¯¨°®¤+.¸¸.·>


read files in current directory:
data=readseizmo('*')

read just the headers of files in current directory:
data=readheader('*')

read just the data (headers must have been read already):
data=readdata(data)

read a partial data window (headers must have been read already):
data=readdatawindow(data,100,200)

write files:
writeseizmo(data)

write just headers:
writeheader(data)

if the shortnames directory has been added:
r   = readseizmo
rh  = readheader
rd  = readdata
rdw = readdatawindow
w   = writeseizmo
wh  = writeheader

<·.¸¸.+¤®°¨¯¨°®¤+.¸¸.·>Working with Metadata of SAC Files<·.¸¸.+¤®°¨¯¨°®¤+.¸¸.·>

if the shortnames directory has been added:
ch    = changeheader
gh    = getheader
lh    = listheader
cmph  = compareheader
cmph2 = compareheader2

other useful header field extraction routines:
getlgc      = returns a logical as a string (ie 'true', 'false', 'undefined', 'unknown')
getenumid   = returns enum id (ie iamph, iunkn, etc)
getenumdesc = returns description of enum id
copyheader  = wholesale header copying
