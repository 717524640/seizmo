<·.¸¸.+¤®°¨¯¨°®¤+.¸¸.·>Installing SEIZMO<·.¸¸.+¤®°¨¯¨°®¤+.¸¸.·>


To install:

1. download and extract the tar volume in the directory
   you want the SEIZMO directory tree to reside:
        cd ~   (your home directory for example)
	tar jxvf seizmo-devel-rXX.tar.bz2

2. this will create a directory tree under seizmo full of useful mfiles

3. add the following folders to your Matlab path (as admin):
   seizmo/devel            (main stuff)
   seizmo/devel/misc       (necessary various functions)
   seizmo/devel/position   (for earth positioning)
   seizmo/devel/time       (for data timing)
   seizmo/devel/mattaup    (taup access)

4. add the mattaup jar-file in matlab using 'edit classpath.txt' (as admin):
   seizmo/devel/mattaup/lib/matTaup.jar

Thats it! The rest is optional. Good luck!

5. the following directories are optional, but recommended:
   seizmo/devel/shortnames      (short-named links to longer-named functions)
   seizmo/devel/gui             (for working with data graphically)
   seizmo/devel/seizmo_internal (link to seizmo private functions)

6. these are often broken but may be useful
   seizmo/devel/align        (for aligning data on a phase)
   seizmo/devel/cluster      (waveform clustering for multi-channel cross correlation)
   seizmo/devel/eqdb         (for working with earthquake lists)
   seizmo/devel/invert       (some inversion scripts)
   seizmo/devel/tomo         (tomography functions from GDA)
   seizmo/devel/tpw          (some functions related to two plane wave work)

7. these directories are external packages included for your convenience
   seizmo/devel/external     (misc stuff I thought was cool or might come in handy)
   seizmo/devel/ttbox        (a free travel time toolbox)
   seizmo/devel/m_map        (a free mapping toolbox)

8. these should be left alone
   seizmo/devel/deprecated   (old and forgotten)
   seizmo/devel/unfinished   (for development)


<·.¸¸.+¤®°¨¯¨°®¤+.¸¸.·>Using SEIZMO<·.¸¸.+¤®°¨¯¨°®¤+.¸¸.·>


The best way to start using SEIZMO is to invest some time
in browsing the functions using Matlab's 'help' command.  
To get a list of all the main functions along with a quick
description:

help devel

You can list functions from other directories as well:
help misc
help time
help position
help mattaup
help shortnames
help seizmo_internal
help gui

Use that list to learn more about individual functions or
type:

help <function>

to jump to a specific function.


<·.¸¸.+¤®°¨¯¨°®¤+.¸¸.·>Reading/Writing SAC Files<·.¸¸.+¤®°¨¯¨°®¤+.¸¸.·>


read files in current directory:
data=readseizmo('*')

read just the headers of files in current directory:
data=readheader('*')

read just the data (headers must have been read already):
data=readdata(data)

read a partial data window (headers must have been read already):
data=readdatawindow(data)

write files:
writeseizmo(data)

write just headers:
writeheader(data)

if the shortnames directory has been added:
r   = readseizmo
rh  = readheader
rd  = readdata
rdw = readdatawindow
w   = writeseizmo
wh  = writeheader

for more info type:
help <function>
 or
help <directory>
