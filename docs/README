<·.¸¸.+¤®°¨¯¨°®¤+.¸¸.·>Installing SEIZMO<·.¸¸.+¤®°¨¯¨°®¤+.¸¸.·>


To install:

1. download and extract the tar volume in the directory
   you want the SEIZMO directory tree to reside:
        cd ~   (your home directory for example)
	tar jxvf seizmo-dev-rXX.tar.bz2
2. this will create a directory tree under seizmo full of useful mfiles
3. add the following folders to your Matlab path
   seizmo/dev              (main functions for working)
   seizmo/dev/support      (helpful functions needed by others)
   seizmo/dev/position     (functions for earth positioning)
   seizmo/dev/time         (functions for data timing)
4. the following directories are optional (and often unfinished/unworking)
   seizmo/dev/shortnames   (short-named links to longer-named functions)
   seizmo/dev/gui          (for working with data graphically)
   seizmo/dev/align        (for aligning data on a phase)
   seizmo/dev/cluster      (waveform clustering for multi-channel cross correlation)
   seizmo/dev/eqdb         (for working with earthquake lists)
   seizmo/dev/inv          (some inversion scripts)
   seizmo/dev/kernels      (a few functions to make Rayleigh plane-wave kernels)
   seizmo/dev/tomo         (tomography functions from GDA)
   seizmo/dev/tpw          (some functions related to two plane wave work)
   seizmo/dev/private_link (link to seizmo private functions - for development)
5. these directories are external packages included for your convenience
   seizmo/dev/ttbox        (a free travel time toolbox)
   seizmo/dev/m_map        (a free mapping toolbox)
6. these should be left alone
   seizmo/dev/deprecated   (old and forgotten)
   seizmo/dev/unfinished   (for development)


<·.¸¸.+¤®°¨¯¨°®¤+.¸¸.·>Using SEIZMO<·.¸¸.+¤®°¨¯¨°®¤+.¸¸.·>


The best way to start using SEIZMO is to invest some time
in browsing the functions using Matlab's 'help' command.  
To get a list of all the main functions along with a quick
description:

help dev

Use that list to learn more about individual functions or
type:

help <function>

to jump to a specific function.


<·.¸¸.+¤®°¨¯¨°®¤+.¸¸.·>Reading/Writing SAC Files<·.¸¸.+¤®°¨¯¨°®¤+.¸¸.·>


read files in current directory:
data=readseizmo('*')

read just the headers of files in current directory:
data=readheader('*')

read just the data (headers must have been read already):
data=readdata(data)

read a partial data window (headers must have been read already):
data=readdatawindow(data)

write files:
writeseizmo(data)

write just headers:
writeheader(data)

if the shortnames directory has been added:
r   = readseizmo
rh  = readheader
rd  = readdata
rdw = readdatawindow
w   = writeseizmo
wh  = writeheader

for more info type:
help <function>

some more advanced examples:
filenames for writing are stored in data.name, 
to change the first record's filename:
data(1).name='mynewfile';

to change several names at once (specifically records 1,4,7,22,9,2):
list={'my' 'list' 'of' 'new' 'names' 'etc'}
[data([1 4 7 22 9 2]).name]=deal(list{:})
