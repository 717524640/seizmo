Things to worry about across Matlab versions:

Prior to 7.3:
1. struct assignment bug
	affects
	- ???

Prior to 7.2:
1. character encoding via fread/fwrite
	affects (???)
	- readheader
	- writeheader
	- writeseizmo

Prior to 7.1:
1. isfield did not handle cell input
	affects:
	- lots... :(
2. cellfun did not handle functions
	affects:
	- seizmocheck
	- checkheader


Current issues with Octave:
	- error needs to support structs
		- worked around
	- error needs to not error on blank messages
		- worked around
	- cell array of function handles should handle space separated (not require commas)
		- worked around?
	- way to assign new field to empty struct
		- worked around
	- setdiff does not handle mixed char/cell
		- does now? (worked around)
	- switch case didn't handle cells prior to 3.2.2
		- friggin update it
