continual/lingering focus
-----------------
bug checks
	- function test scripts
	- test data
	- class support
	- structure checks
	- multi-component support
	- warnings associated with correct function
	- dataless (npts==0) support
clean up documentation
	- description includes usage
	- examples
	- requirements
	- see also
	- notes/warnings/problems


current focus
-------------------
iirfilter
	- allow variable input
	- clean up the corners
	- figure out best way to handle overdesigned filters
group warning commands (how?)


more function ideas (0.5.?)
------------------

fitting
- get poly (gpoly)
- rem poly (rpoly)
- get smooth spline (gspline)
- rem smooth spline (rspline)
- get robust poly (grobpoly)
- rem robust poly (rrobpoly)

signal cleaning
- detect glitches (gspikes)
- rem glitches (rspikes)
- detect offsets (goffsets)
- rem offsets (roffsets)

smoothing filters (sliding window function)
+ rms, robustrms
- weighted rms? (mean weighted by windowing function)
- non-root/square function (just a mean/median)

fir deci (deci2)
- causal decimation, linear phase

fetch record (frec)
- by component
	- one component only
	- files without cmp not returned
	- iftype is ixy
- by header field/value

get header definition (ghd)
 - for cleaning up some low level functions
 - inputs should contain necessary parent fields too
 - allow structure output??


more plotting (0.5.1)
-----------------
spectral plotting (pspec1, pspec2, pspec3)
plot choose component (pcmp1, pcmp2, pcmp3)
plot particle motion (multi-component)
spectrogram (get familiar with it)
picking phases (get familiar with ppk)


multi-file functions (0.5.2)
---------------------------
rotate (turn)
merge
add, subtr, mul, dvide records
correlate (use mcxc!)
beam
stack
plot versus


guis (0.5.3)
-------------------------
window
align
pick
delete


transfer (0.5.4)
-----------------------
remove polezeros
from - to - setup


header layout change (slated for 0.6.0)
-------------------------------
header partitioned by field type
	- fixes int64 limitation (not particularly useful)
	- improves memory usage (8x better for strings)
	- requires reworked header definition (sub-structuring)
	- may require significant rewriting of header access functions
	- changing version may become complicated
	- partial implementation just separating numeric and string portions
	  will probably avoid the most headache


add readme (saclab.m) and examples (?.?.?)
-------------------------
	- features
	- tutorials
